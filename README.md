#  Hangman Game

##  Game Overview
**Hangman Game** is a simple yet engaging word-guessing game where players try to uncover a hidden word by guessing its letters one at a time. Each incorrect guess brings them closer to losing, as a hangman figure gradually takes shape. The game ends when the player successfully guesses all the letters or runs out of attempts.

This project was developed as part of the General Assembly Software Development Bootcamp, showcasing fundamental programming skills and interactive web development techniques.
